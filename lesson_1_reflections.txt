How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
by highlighting the differences, it makes easier to find typos ormispelled words that were correct in the previous version

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
It reminds you about your progresses and shows the different ways you used to solve problems before learning new things

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions
automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
you can create meaningfull versions of each file, without overloading the history: however there are no clear rules on how often
to commit a version so you could miss a necessary commitment

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs,
treat each file separately?
To keep their tight relationship

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
i can use git log to see the id of the commit i'm interested in and then copare it with the previous version by using git diff with
the two ID
